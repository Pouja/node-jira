Forked repo of steves/node-jira.  
What I added are  
 * DEBUG library, so we can get a more verbose output on what is happening
 * favorites, you can now request all the favourites of the current user
 * requestRef, some requests return an direct http adres where more information can be retrieved. You can pass that direct into requestRef.
